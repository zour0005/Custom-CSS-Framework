# Custom CSS Framework

A custom CSS framework built using Sass that provides a flexible theming system and utility classes for common styling.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Include the compiled CSS file in your HTML.
3. Customize the framework variables in the Sass files to match your design preferences.

## Usage

### Theming

To customize the framework's theme, modify the variables in the `_variables.scss` file.

### Utility Classes

Use utility classes to apply common styling:

- `.text-primary`: Sets text color to the primary color.
- `.bg-secondary`: Sets the background color to the secondary color.
- `.margin-10`: Adds a margin of 10px to all sides.
- `.padding-20`: Adds padding of 20px to all sides.
- `.border-rounded`: Applies rounded corners to an element.

## Customization

You can customize the framework by editing the Sass variables in `_variables.scss`. These variables control colors, fonts, and other design elements.
