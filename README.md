# Custom CSS Framework

A lightweight and customizable CSS framework.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Sass code to CSS using a Sass compiler.
3. Link the compiled `main.css` in your HTML.

## Usage

To use the Custom CSS Framework, simply add the appropriate classes to your HTML elements. For example:

```html
<h1 class="custom-heading">Custom Heading</h1>
<p class="custom-text">This is some text with custom styling.</p>
<button class="custom-button">Click me</button>



### Theming

To customize the framework's theme, modify the variables in the `_variables.scss` file.

NOTE: Due I don't have a team for this project, the other two (Theme) elements are 

- Colours 
- Fonts.

### Utility Classes

Use utility classes to apply common styling:

- `.text-primary`: Sets text color to the primary color.
- `.bg-secondary`: Sets the background color to the secondary color.
- `.margin-10`: Adds a margin of 10px to all sides.
- `.padding-20`: Adds padding of 20px to all sides.
- `.border-rounded`: Applies rounded corners to an element.
- `.bg-secondary`: Set onther background color option to the secondary color.

## Customization

You can customize the framework by editing the Sass variables in `_variables.scss`. These variables control colors, fonts, and other design elements.
